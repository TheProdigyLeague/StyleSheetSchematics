# Beyond just a technology
*Sass is powered by a community of people.*

What fuels its daily development and usage? 

A group, and we wish to accept the very distinctions that have strengthened and improved our partnership-collaborate to create the ideal setting for growth, learning, and sharing of notions. We must continue to make Sass an enjoyable, friendly, demanding, and a fair field for play.
